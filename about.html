    <h1 class="garden-title">About My Digital Garden</h1>
    <h2 class="garden-title">What is a Digital Garden?</h2>
    <p class="garden-content">If you want a comprehensive summary of digital gardening, you can't go wrong with Maggie Appleton's <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden</a> or her <a href="https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners">repo of resources</a>. Digital gardening has been around since the late 90's. In short, if Medium is a stream, Wikipedia is a garden. The ideal digital garden is a community garden - ease of sharing, contextualization, and availability of information are very important.
    A digital garden is never complete. It grows as you learn and grow. It lies somewhere in between taking notes and blogging. Instead of time, content is curated by topic, state of completion, and how it's related to other content. 
    The digital garden ethos embraces imperfection, and with it, transparency and meta categorization for the user. Gardeners are encouraged to experiment, use diverse media formats, and find the tools that are sustainable for them, even if they don't involve coding.
    Underpinning the whole philosophy is a sense of optimism about the future of the web. Digital gardeners want to push the boundaries of webpage interconnectivity through technologies like web messaging. They strive to put their information in the hands of anyone who wants it.
    Plus, a digital garden provides endless opportunities for plant analogies and puns.</p>
    <h2 class="garden-title">My Garden</h2>
    <p class="garden-content">As it stands, my blog timeline would give you topic whiplash. In contrast, a digital garden works with how my brain works - grouping related articles together even if I wrote them 5 years apart. Bidirectional links will encourage jumping down rabbit holes. The emphasis is on growing a store of interconnected information naturally rather than perfect isolated pieces, and I'm no stranger to learning and building in public.
    My digital garden is to be an organic home for all my tech creations. My stack is JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Markdown. I originally spun up a website in a new framework I wanted to try and quickly realized a framework was far more than I needed and not as sustainable as I wanted.
    Many have suggested I should host my own blog, and initially, I didn't see a need. Now, the more I create content in formats other than writing, the more I want a central place for everything I create. Plus, I've got to justify that domain purchase somehow.
    I've written before about my nostalgia for a time when everyone slapped up a personal website to share information, and now's my chance to put my money where my mouth is. The more I learn about the web and digital accessibility, the less I can justify paywalls and walled gardens.</p>
