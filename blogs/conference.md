Conferences are filled with fun and opportunities. Do a little prep beforehand to set yourself up for success.

## 1. Research the Conference

Find out what's in the area and what past attendees have to say. It may save you a lot of time, money, trouble, and hunger.

## 2. Look Up Food in the Area

A lot of conferences provide breakfast and lunch, but you don't know how long the lines are going to be.

If you want to eat in a group, make dinner plans early in the day before you usually start to get hungry. If you have dietary restrictions, make a list of restaurants that work for you. You'll probably want to steer towards casual restaurants that don't require reservations.

## 3. Explore

If you're not local, try to schedule at least half a day to explore a new city.

If you're local, prepare some recommendations for people. They'll want to know where to eat, and fun stuff to do near the conference venue.

## 4. You Can't Do Everything

Without a doubt, you will miss a talk, event, or cool thing at every conference. Sometimes talks and events overlap. More importantly, physically and mentally you can only do so much.

Check the schedule and prioritize the talks and events you really want to go to. Don't sweat missing the rest.

If you know you're prone to overstimulation, make time to relax in a quiet space at least once a day.

## 5. Make (or Bring) Con Buddies

Look up friends in the area. Talk to speakers after their talks. Talk to people you see attending the same talks as you. If you know you struggle with small talk, think about questions to ask people before you go.

If all else fails, stand next to an extrovert.

## 6. Keep Plans Loose

Start a group chat with people you want to see during con. If there are a lot of people in one area, use an app that uses wifi, not mobile service.

Announce your plans in the group chat. If you want people to join you, give a specific meetup time, duration, and location when possible. If there's a large crowd, pick an easy-to-find landmark as a meeting place.

If you're traveling alone, this is a great way to make sure someone knows where you are/plan to be.

## 7. Make It Easy to Contact You

Whether it's a QR code, a business card, or stickers, make it possible to exchange info in seconds. If you're making new con buddies, make sure to give them a way to contact you that you will actually check during the conference. (Sorry, Will.)

## 8. Bring Something Small to Gift to Others

Stickers, small toys, photos from an Instax camera - everyone loves a physical memory of an event they enjoyed. Give the swag you wanna get. It's a simple way to be memorable and something to do with your hands if you feel awkward when meeting new people.

## 9. Lift Others Up

Refer others for opportunities. If you're in a group, introduce everyone when someone new walks up. Encourage those with less experience. Being kind costs you nothing. In the tech community, word quickly gets around if you're not kind.

## 10. Post About Talks

1. Take a photo during a talk you're attending.
2. Zoom in and make sure it's flattering.
3. Write a social media post with a summary and ideally a compliment.
4. Tag the speaker.

Instant networking from the safety of your seat.

## 11. Listen To Your Body

The absolute minimum self-care for one day at a conference is 1 shower, 2 meals, and 3 hours of sleep. Shoot for more than that.

If you struggle to remember to eat at events, bring lots of snacks and ask your con buddy to make sure you've made dinner plans every day.

Chairs and easy travel aren't guaranteed, so prioritize your comfort and plan ahead.

### Daily Backpack

If I'm going to a local conference or leaving my hotel room to go to the conference venue, I'll pack a backpack with essentials, including:

- portable battery and/or charging cords
- headphones
- refillable water bottle
- prepackaged snacks, ideally with protein
- something to take notes
- tide stick
- sticker box
- fidget toys
- fan (during hot weather)

Expect to pick up swag and leave room in your backpack for it.

### Extended Stay

If I'm flying, I'll often make a stop at a grocery store or pharmacy and buy enough seltzer or water to keep me hydrated for the trip. If I'm driving, you know there's a box of Spindrift packed. Essentials include:

- electrolytes
- instant meals
- snacks
- first aid kit with blister bandages
- safety pins
- scissors
- cash

If I'm bringing costumes or dressing up one night, you know I'm bringing a repair kit including a sewing kit and fabric tape at a minimum.

## Conclusion

When my friend told me that I was prepared for tech conferences because I had been going to DragonCon for years, I did not believe him. Kirk, you were very correct.
