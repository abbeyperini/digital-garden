It’s been 323 days since I first started this coding journey. Today I finished the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) — a public commitment to code an hour on personal projects every day for 100 days.

One of Kallaway’s rules is that you can miss a day, but not two days. With the exception of 4 day breaks over Thanksgiving and Christmas, I achieved that… while completing DigitalCrafts’ Immersive Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Would I recommend everyone do #100DaysOfCode on top of a bootcamp? No. However, I would say #100DaysOfCode kept my love of coding in perspective through the grind of the final weeks of my bootcamp.

A few of the things I learned about on my own or created thanks to #100DaysOfCode:

* Algorithm solutions
* JavaScript Fetch requests
* API endpoints
* CSS Grid
* JavaScript animated photo libraries
* Ternary operators
* Accessible CSS dropdown menu
* PostgreSQL
* Web design standards
* Common responsive layouts
* React
* Redux
* Svgs
* Svgs in React
* JSON Web Tokens
* `React-router-dom`
* Javascript date time objects
* SQL queries and Sequelize
* Hierarchy in design (e.g. buttons, colors, typography)
* CSS animations
* Axios and its request headers
* Making sure server side has no unhandled exceptions
* Python Discord bot on Repl.it
* Writing a React app without `npx create-react-app`

Looking back at the completed log, I can’t help but feel pride in how far I’ve come. In the beginning of the challenge, I spent days trying to decipher the appropriate endpoints for the [Ravelry API](https://www.ravelry.com/api) that I eventually used for my first group project (check out [Knitworthy](http://knitworthy.net/) and its [Github repo](https://github.com/abbeyperini/Knitworthy)). Now accessing the API is usually the easiest first step of a project.

Trying to find that extra hour of coding drove me to complete most of the optional assignments provided by the bootcamp. They often involved delete and edit operations, so #100DaysOfCode is partially responsible for my comfort level with CRUD operations.

Most importantly, when classes started in September, I had trouble starting projects — either from lack of ideas or fear of failure. By the end of #100DaysOfCode, my log entries changed from “I’ll try and get this feature of this assignment working because I want to” to “I built this on a whim in a new language and loved it.”

### Conclusion

The #100DaysOfCode challenge and its online community welcome and challenge coders of any level. If you’re looking for a way to kickstart your personal projects this year, I would recommend it. If nothing else, at the end of 100 days, you’ll have a log of everything you learned about and created.

For me, that log is a welcome reminder while I’m job searching. Not only does it show how much I’ve learned in a short amount of time, but it proves a sustained desire to create with code… even when I’m already stressed out from coding 8+ hours a day.

I spent my final #100DaysOfCode hour rebuilding my portfolio — it was a template tacked on to a static site I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before starting the bootcamp. Now it’ll be a single page app built in React.
